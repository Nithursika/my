# [Backstage](https://backstage.io)

This is your newly scaffolded Backstage App, Good Luck!

To start the app, run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```


 <!-- if you're running Backstage with Node 20 or later, you'll need to pass the flag --no-node-snapshot to Node in order to use the templates feature. One way to do this is to specify the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable before starting Backstage: export NODE_OPTIONS=--no-node-snapshot -->  
 # use $env:NODE_OPTIONS="--no-node-snapshot"
